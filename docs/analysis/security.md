# Security Analysis Documentation

## Overview
PackApi includes a dedicated security inspection component used to gather vulnerability reports from multiple sources. The goal is to detect known issues in thirdâ€‘party packages so you can act before deploying them in production.

## Security Inspector

### Configuration
There is no global configuration class. Compose the `SecurityInspector` with providers created via their factories (e.g., Packagist, OSV, GitHub). Configure HTTP behavior via `HttpClientFactory` options and environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

### Provider Registration
All security providers implement `SecurityProviderInterface`. They are automatically registered by their respective bridge factories but can also be added manually for custom implementations.

### Usage
```php
$inspector = new SecurityInspector([$securityProvider]);
$advisories = $inspector->getSecurityAdvisories(new ComposerPackage('vendor/package'));
```

## Security Advisory Model

### Properties
Every advisory exposes an identifier, summary, publication date and affected version range.

### Severity Levels
Advisories are classified into LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and CRITICAL levels.

### CVSS Scoring
If available, CVSS vectors are mapped to numeric scores for easier comparison.

## Provider Implementations

### GitHub Security Provider
Retrieves advisories from the GitHub Advisory Database when a repository URL is available.

### Packagist Security Provider
Fetches advisories published on Packagist, including those propagated from the FriendsOfPHP security advisories repository.

### OSV Security Provider
Queries the [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) database for known vulnerabilities affecting the package. See the [OSV Bridge documentation](../bridges/osv.md) for configuration details.

## Vulnerability Detection

### Advisory Sources
Providers combine information from the above databases to build a complete list of known vulnerabilities.

### Severity Assessment
Severity is normalized across sources to make it easier to filter high risk advisories.

### Affected Versions
Each advisory describes the range of versions that are vulnerable so upgrades can be planned accordingly.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Scan
```php
$scanner = new SecurityInspector([$githubProvider, $osvProvider]);
$result = $scanner->getSecurityAdvisories(new ComposerPackage('symfony/console'));
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
After fetching advisories you may aggregate them by severity or affected versions to determine the risk level of a package.

### Risk Analysis
Combine security scanning results with metadata and activity information to decide whether a package should be used in your project.

## Error Handling

### Provider Exceptions
Network issues or malformed responses will throw a `ProviderException`. Always wrap calls in a try/catch block.

### API Failures
When a remote service is unavailable the inspector records the failure and continues with other providers.

### Missing Advisories
If no provider can deliver advisories for a package, an empty result is returned without errors.

## Security Best Practices

### Data Validation
Always validate package names and versions before passing them to the inspector to avoid injection issues.

### Secure Communication
Use HTTPS for all outgoing requests and verify SSL certificates.

### Access Control
Restrict who can trigger security scans and store advisories securely.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Providers include unit tests for edge cases and error conditions.

### Integration Tests
Mocked HTTP clients are used to exercise full inspector workflows.

### Security Tests
You can add your own regression tests for known vulnerabilities using the OSV provider.

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Scanning
Multiple providers can run in parallel to speed up analysis.

### Cache Strategy
Responses from remote services are cached to avoid hitting API limits.

### Rate Limiting
The inspector uses token bucket rate limiters when services enforce quotas.

## Future Enhancements

### Custom Advisory Sources
Support for additional ecosystems such as PyPI or Maven Central could be added via new bridges.

### Risk Scoring
Combine severity and metadata metrics into an overall package risk score.

### Automated Remediation
Future versions may offer suggestions for dependency updates or patches.
